    <div class="about">
      <section>
        <p>Growing up around several small businesses in Columbia, SC gave me an excellent sense of business, finance and accounting at a very young age. I watched both my parents run their own business and I spent ample amount of time around the businesses in between school and playing sports.</p>
        <p>From a very early age I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in public accounting and become a Certified Public Accountant in order to serve those small businesses that I grew up around in order to help them prosper. After graduating Summa Cum Laude from Liberty University, I knew I had to earn my masterâ€™s degree in order to become a CPA. I successfully completed my masters in accounting from Liberty University in July of 2015, and I am currently sitting for the CPA exam. I have already successfully completed the Regulation (REG) section of the exam, and I am currently studying for Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) while waiting to receive my scores from other sections.</p>
        <p>Outside of accounting, I enjoy investing, playing sports, going deep sea fishing, riding ATVs, wakeboarding, and going to the lake.</p>
